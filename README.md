# Boxy

**Boxy is a custom, terminal-based IDE in a box powered by Docker.** If you prefer working in a graphical IDE, this setup won't be for you, but if you like working in the terminal, Boxy could provide you the following benefits:

- A portable, reproducible IDE. Because your IDE lives in a Docker container defined by a `Dockerfile`, you can run it anywhere that supports Docker. Setting up a new computer is a piece of cake!
- A cleaner workstation. Never again will you have to clutter your computer with multiple versions of all kinds of different development tools; instead, your project dependencies can live in a project-specific Boxy container.
